About

MKernel is embedded RTOS, based on microkernel architecture.
It's designed for ARM microprocessors, however, can be easily ported to any
32bit MCU.

Features:

- BSD License, royalty free, open source.
- Tickless. For system scheduling used 1 HPET timer and RTC. If RTC is
unavailable, another HPET timer can be used for RTC emulation (with full RTC
functionality)
- Hardware abstraction.RTOS is providing common interface for drivers.
- Standart microkernel syncronization: mutexes, events, semaphores, queues.
- Nested mutex priority inheritance
- Embedded dynamic memory manager, with ability of nested memory pools for 
  threads, dedicated system pool. Aligned malloc calls inside of any pools
- Safe and MPU ready. All supervisor-specific calls are wrapped around 
  swi/svc calls for context rising.
- Embedded libraries:
  * printf/sprintf. Around 1k of code.
  * time routines. POSIX-light
  * single-linked list, double linked list, ring buffer, block ring buffer
  * random number generation: hardware (if supported) or software
- Error handling:
  * kill thread on system error, print error, if configured
  * restart system on critical error, memory dump if configured
  * handle error exceptions, decode address (if supported) and exception code
- Lot of debug features:
  * memory dumps
  * object marks
  * thread profiling: name, uptime, stack allocated/current/used
  * memory profiling: red-markings, pool free/allocated size, objects fragmentation
  * stack profiling: supervisor allocated/current/used. Plus for arm7 - irq, fiq, abt
  * configurable debug console
- Supported hardware:
  * ARM7
  * cortex-m3, drivers for:STM32 F2 (gpio, uart, rcc, timer, dma, rand)

Cortex-M3 features:
- Native SVC and pendSV support

ARM7 features:
- Nested interrupts
- FIQ support
- pendSV emulation, when returning to user/system context
